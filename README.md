# Credit to Author
This project was forked from https://github.com/NishanthShankar/codepush-action and updated to use a working directory argument. This was needed to make the action work for a monorepo environment.

# GitHub Actions for Firebase

This Action for [appcenter codepush](https://github.com/microsoft/appcenter-cli) enables arbitrary actions with the `appcenter` command-line client.

## Inputs

* `directory` - Directory from which to run the command
* `args` - **Required**. This is the arguments you want to use for the `appcenter` cli


## Environment variables

* `APPCENTER_ACCESS_TOKEN` - **Required**. The token to use for authentication. This token can be aquired through the `appcenter dashboard`.

## Example

To authenticate with Codepush, and deploy to Codepush:

```yaml

  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
